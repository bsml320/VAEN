# VAEN
A deep generative neural network based approach to impute drug response

--main
    Code and results for different preprocessing methods and VAE

--DATA
    Data required to run all codes, including the downloaded data for CCLE, GDSC, and TCGA

--Figure
    Code to reproduce all figures
    
--result
    VAE results for RANK+Sigmoid

--result.EN
    VAEN results for CCLE (dr.CCLE) and GDSC (dr.GDSC). These are the imputed drug response for CCLE (cell lines), GDSC (cell lines), and TCGA (cancer samples).
    
--MC3
    TCGA mutation data.
    
--code
    Other supporting code
